        <h2 id="day-one">Day One</h2>
<p>I have created this portfolio website and blog to showcase my progress to improve my <strong><em>Front End Developer</em></strong> fundamentals.</p>
<p>I spent most of the day configuring this website to host and deploy it on Github Pages.</p>
<p>I have also started the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations">Foundations</a> course from The Odin Project. Although, most of it is Review from previous experience, I felt that it is a good idea start from scratch as it is a good refresher as I may have forgotten some things I learned in the past.</p>
<h2 id="day-two">Day Two</h2>
<p>I am still going through the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations">Foundations</a> course.
Things I did include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#prerequisites">Setting up the development environment.</a>
<ul>
<li>The Odin Project uses Unix Based Operating Systems, thus I had to set up Linux Xubuntu on my Windows computer using VirtualBox.</li>
<li>Installing Google Chrome and VSCode as the primary web browser and text editor</li>
<li>Learning Command Line Basics for the Terminal
<ul>
<li>I spent most of the day reviewing Linux commands as I&rsquo;m used to Windows</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="day-three">Day Three</h2>
<p>I am almost done the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations">Foundations</a> course.</p>
<p>Things I did include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set up Git in my Linux workspace
<ul>
<li>Reviewed git basics</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Completing the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#html-foundations">HTML Foundations</a> section
<ul>
<li>My version of the final project <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes">Recipes</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I also setup changing the domain of my portfolio site to mishaelmagsanoc.com</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="day-four">Day Four</h2>
<p>I spent the whole day trying to complete the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#css-foundations">CSS Foundations</a> section of The Odin Project.</p>
<p>I am currently on The Box Model about 1/3 of the way done.</p>
<h2 id="day-five">Day Five</h2>
<p>I was completely sidetracked today as I had errands to run but I finally finished The Box Model. Next Week, I promise that I will give my entire focus on The Odin Project.</p>
<h2 id="day-six">Day Six</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s a Saturday and I decided to be productive and continue my studies. I started the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#css-foundations">CSS Foundations</a> section and I have almost completed it. The only thing left is to complete the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page">Project: Landing Page</a> exercise. As of now, I spent most of the day with theory and will most likely start it either tomorrow on Sunday, or Monday.</p>
