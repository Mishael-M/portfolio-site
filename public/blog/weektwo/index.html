        <h2 id="day-one">Day One</h2>
<p>I started and completed the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page">Project: Landing Page</a> and my solution can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/Mishael-M/odin-landing-page">GitHub</a> with the hosted website <a href="https://mishael-m.github.io/odin-landing-page/">here</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>What I can say from completing this web page is that CSS is very tiresome. Hopefully with enough practice and experience, I will start to like it.</li>
<li>I have also started the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#javascript-basics">JavaScript Basics Section</a>
<ul>
<li>For the most part, I have skimmed through the Parts 1 and 2 because I have solid knowledge on the basics of JavaScript</li>
<li>As of now, I have almost completed the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-javascript-developer-tools">JavaScript Developer Tools Topic</a></li>
<li>My goals for this section is to finish it as fast as I can because I have faith in my proficiency in programming which includes JavaScript.
<ul>
<li>I would like to start the JavaScript path as most of the HTML/CSS there is entirely new for myself.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="day-two">Day Two</h2>
<p>I am still in the process of completing the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#javascript-basics">JavaScript Basics Section</a>.</p>
<p>Things that I have done for today are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Completed the Javascript Developer Tools Topic</li>
<li>Skipped over Fundamentals Part 3 because I had previous experience with the topic of functions.</li>
<li>Finished the Problem Solving and Understanding Errors topics
<ul>
<li>These topics are always good to have in the back of my mind, especially when programming</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I skipped the Project: Rock Paper Scissors because I have already completed it back in the past when I first tried The Odin Project in 2018
<ul>
<li>My solution can be found <a href="https://github.com/Mishael-M/rock-paper-scissors-ui">here</a> and the live website <a href="https://mishael-m.github.io/rock-paper-scissors-ui/">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I reviewed the Clean Code topic to ensure that I have the right mindset going into programming</li>
<li>I installed Node.js and zipped through Fundamentals Part 4, which against was mostly review as these JavaScript topics are only introductory.</li>
<li>I am now currently completing the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-dom-manipulation-and-events">DOM Manipulation and Events topic</a> which is a topic I last touched about 3 years ago
<ul>
<li>Since I do have experience in React, these concepts are abstracted away when using a JavaScript framework</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="day-three">Day Three</h2>
<p>I am almost done the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#javascript-basics">JavaScript Basics Section</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>I completed the DOM Manipulation and Events section</li>
<li>I completed the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch">Project: Etch-a-Sketch</a> in the past.
<ul>
<li>My solution can be found <a href="https://github.com/Mishael-M/etch-a-sketch">here</a> and the deployed website can be found <a href="https://mishael-m.github.io/etch-a-sketch/">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I have completed the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-fundamentals-part-5">Fundamentals Part 5 topic</a>
<ul>
<li>This was mostly review as I had previous knowledge with objects and arrays for JavaScript.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>My goal tomorrow is to finish the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator">Calculator Project</a> as well as to start the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript">Full Stack JavaScript path</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="day-four">Day Four</h2>
<p>I got sidetracked today and decided to start the <a href="https://grow.google/intl/ALL_ca/certificates/ux-design/#?modal_active=none">Google UX Design Certificate</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The reason I am starting this course is because I don&rsquo;t have any practice regarding UX design and I want to apply this knowledge alongside my Front End skills.</li>
<li>Overall, I think by doing this course alongside improving my Front End skills, I can start creating much more beautiful user interfaces and a better experience for the users.</li>
</ul>
