      <description>Day One I have created this portfolio website and blog to showcase my progress to improve my Front End Developer fundamentals.
I spent most of the day configuring this website to host and deploy it on Github Pages.
I have also started the Foundations course from The Odin Project. Although, most of it is Review from previous experience, I felt that it is a good idea start from scratch as it is a good refresher as I may have forgotten some things I learned in the past.</description>

      <description>Hello everyone, this is my first post on my personal blog.
I am currently trying to practice my Front End Developer fundamentals using The Odin Project as I have previously learned Full Stack Development using FullStackOpen. Although, I have learned to create Full Stack applications using Javascript, I believe I am severely lacking in the fundamentals of HTML5, CSS, and JS due to the fact that FullStackOpen uses React at the very start.</description>
