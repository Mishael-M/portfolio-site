Hello, my name is Mishael Magsanoc and I am a Full Stack Developer.

I specialize in backend development using Java Spring Boot & Express.js and have experience in creating Single Page Applications using React.

I am currently practicing my Front-End Developer fundamentals of HTML5, CSS, and JS using [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). I am also going through the [Google UX Design Certification Course](https://grow.google/intl/ALL_ca/certificates/ux-design/#?modal_active=none).
