Hello everyone, this is my first post on my personal blog.

I am currently trying to practice my **_Front End Developer_** fundamentals using The Odin Project as I have previously learned Full Stack Development using [FullStackOpen](https://fullstackopen.com/en/). Although, I have learned to create Full Stack applications using Javascript, I believe I am severely lacking in the fundamentals of HTML5, CSS, and JS due to the fact that FullStackOpen uses React at the very start.

Thus, I would like to document my progress for my **_Front End Developer_** skills to help see how I grow to become the best Full Stack Developer I can be.

I will be creating weekly posts with each post being updated daily on what I have learned so far.
