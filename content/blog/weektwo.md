## Day One

I started and completed the [Project: Landing Page](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page) and my solution can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/Mishael-M/odin-landing-page) with the hosted website [here](https://mishael-m.github.io/odin-landing-page/).

- What I can say from completing this web page is that CSS is very tiresome. Hopefully with enough practice and experience, I will start to like it.
- I have also started the [JavaScript Basics Section](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#javascript-basics)
  - For the most part, I have skimmed through the Parts 1 and 2 because I have solid knowledge on the basics of JavaScript
  - As of now, I have almost completed the [JavaScript Developer Tools Section](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-javascript-developer-tools)
  - My goals for this section is to finish it as fast as I can because I have faith in my proficiency in programming which includes JavaScript.
    - I would like to start the JavaScript path as most of the HTML/CSS there is entirely new for myself.
