## Day One

I am now practicing leetcode to help keep my mind fresh on Data Structures and Algorithms. I am using NeetCode and Abdul Bari on YouTube to help teach me the concepts that I can apply to solve these problems. By doing leetcode, I want to ensure that if I do get interviews, I will have some sort of experience in trying to solve the technical problems given.

I am also steadily going through the Google UX design course.

I feel like this will be my routine for the next couple of weeks until I finish the UX design course.

## Day Two

I started off the day once again with leetcode, going through the topic of Backtracking algorithms.

I have also finished Week 1 of the Google UX Design course. All the topics I have learned for Week 1 are:

- What UX Design is
  - Types of Careers and jobs
  - The Product Development Life Cycle
  - Characteristics of good UX

After completing Week 1, I think it was a good introduction to UX Design. I can't wait to learn more about it and start learning and applying these concepts to create my own case studies.
