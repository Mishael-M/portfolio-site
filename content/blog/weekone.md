## Day One

I have created this portfolio website and blog to showcase my progress to improve my **_Front End Developer_** fundamentals.

I spent most of the day configuring this website to host and deploy it on Github Pages.

I have also started the [Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) course from The Odin Project. Although, most of it is Review from previous experience, I felt that it is a good idea start from scratch as it is a good refresher as I may have forgotten some things I learned in the past.

## Day Two

I am still going through the [Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) course.
Things I did include:

- [Setting up the development environment.](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#prerequisites)
  - The Odin Project uses Unix Based Operating Systems, thus I had to set up Linux Xubuntu on my Windows computer using VirtualBox.
  - Installing Google Chrome and VSCode as the primary web browser and text editor
  - Learning Command Line Basics for the Terminal
    - I spent most of the day reviewing Linux commands as I'm used to Windows
