## Day One

I have created this portfolio website and blog to showcase my progress to improve my **_Front End Developer_** fundamentals.

I have started the [Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) course from The Odin Project. Although, most of it is Review from previous experience, I felt that I needed to start from scratch as it is a good refresher as I may have forgotten some things I learned in the past.
