## Day One

I have created this portfolio website and blog to showcase my progress to improve my **_Front End Developer_** fundamentals.

I spent most of the day configuring this website to host and deploy it on Github Pages.

I have also started the [Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) course from The Odin Project. Although, most of it is Review from previous experience, I felt that it is a good idea start from scratch as it is a good refresher as I may have forgotten some things I learned in the past.

## Day Two

I am still going through the [Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) course.
Things I did include:

- [Setting up the development environment.](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#prerequisites)
  - The Odin Project uses Unix Based Operating Systems, thus I had to set up Linux Xubuntu on my Windows computer using VirtualBox.
  - Installing Google Chrome and VSCode as the primary web browser and text editor
  - Learning Command Line Basics for the Terminal
    - I spent most of the day reviewing Linux commands as I'm used to Windows

## Day Three

I am almost done the [Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) course.

Things I did include:

- Set up Git in my Linux workspace
  - Reviewed git basics
- Completing the [HTML Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#html-foundations) section
  - My version of the final project [Recipes](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes)
- I also setup changing the domain of my portfolio site to mishaelmagsanoc.com

## Day Four

I spent the whole day trying to complete the [CSS Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#css-foundations) section of The Odin Project.

I am currently on The Box Model about 1/3 of the way done.

## Day Five

I was completely sidetracked today as I had errands to run but I finally finished The Box Model. Next Week, I promise that I will give my entire focus on The Odin Project.

## Day Six

It's a Saturday and I decided to be productive and continue my studies. I started the [CSS Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#css-foundations) section and I have almost completed it. The only thing left is to complete the [Project: Landing Page](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page) exercise. As of now, I spent most of the day with theory and will most likely start it either tomorrow on Sunday, or Monday.
