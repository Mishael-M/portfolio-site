## Day One

I went through a bit of the UX Design course but I was out with family the majority of the day.

## Day Two

I spent most of my time finishing [Project: Calculator](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator) and have finished the basic features. Tomorrow I will focus on finishing the extra credit portion.
I am also slowly going through the Google UX Design course, trying to gather as much knowledge I can for future Front End projects.
